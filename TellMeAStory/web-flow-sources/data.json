You get enough of that out in the world, you shouldn’t have to be judged when you're at home.

So what I did was I just slowly backed off of it. I lied through my teeth and said I wasn’t doing it, but it was the weirdest thing, I looked at it like dieting. If I could get $200, you could bet I had 20 rocks in my pocket and would smoke them in a day. And I just backed up. I slowed down. Just like you cut your food portions, I cut and I cut and I backed up and I backed up. And I prayed to God for strength, or to the higher power, because I didn’t necessarily believe in a God but in the possibility of a higher power, and I prayed for the inner strength, and somehow I had it.

So I said to myself – well, you know what? You need to do something differently, so that doesn’t end up happening. And the only answer was I needed to get the strength to stop doing that stuff. So what I did was I just slowly backed off of it. I lied through my teeth and said I wasn’t doing it, but it was the weirdest thing, I looked at it like dieting. If I could get $200, you could bet I had 20 rocks in my pocket and would smoke them in a day. And I just backed up. I slowed down. Just like you cut your food portions, I cut and I cut and I backed up and I backed up. And I prayed to God for strength, or to the higher power, because I didn’t necessarily believe in a God but in the possibility of a higher power, and I prayed for the inner strength, and somehow I had it.

They’ll take that $100 and feed their children. Because that $100 probably could feed their kids for the month, if you're living in poverty.

I never got to the point of doing things for drugs because I had family that tried that kept me off the streets, or tried to keep me off the streets. So I was good on that level but (sigh) I still did a lot of things that I'm not proud of back then, yes.",

I'm a researcher and I'm very, very in tune with my body so I know when something’s not right. I caught a cold, turned into strep, and then the lymph nodes in my neck swelled up. They swelled so bad that I couldn't really turn my neck and I could see lumps sitting outside my neck and I'm just like – oh my gosh, what is that? So researching all the symptoms I had led to lymphoma. Okay, I'm going to call my doctor, I think it’s this but I'm not a doctor so I don't know. And also it wasn’t like okay, this is hanging on for like two days. We’re talking weeks this thing is going on. So I'm scared, call the doctor, I said – I want a biopsy. \n\tWell, when I went in, went to the health department, and they had already had test results from my last HIV test. Normally I never go back for an HIV test, any STD tests were always negative. And I knew how to protect myself. Well, I had been tested since I’d been with my now ex-husband and I didn't go back for test results, because they're always negative. Well, the health department failed to contact me. I slipped through the cracks, they actually told me that because they were trying to say well, we tried to call you, we tried to send you a letter…well no, you didn't. I still live at the same place, phone number’s been the same for years, no you didn't. Just long story short they told me I slipped through the cracks but when I got the news, the nurse couldn't even verbally tell me. Because they all knew me, I'm a really nice person and when I go into places I become a joy (laughter). \n\tWhen I went there I'm sitting in a room, half the size of the room I’m in now, and she pushes a folder towards me and opens it and in red it said HIV Positive. And that’s how I learned. She just couldn’t…It wasn’t that she wasn’t being professional, she was hurt, she was hurt for me. Because her whole demeanor just I just didn't understand. When I got it I screamed, I cried, man I just wanted to leave. I tried to get my keys and my purse, I went to get it and it was gone because she had it hiding behind her and she was barricading the door and she just didn't want me to leave. I understand that. I was telling this story to someone before and they're like – oh my gosh why would she do that? For my protection. I was upset, I was distraught, and I wanted to get in my car and drive. Well, what if I did that? I could have had an accident or anything could have happened. But hearing that news, gosh…",

I said, yeah baby? She said are you sick? I said yes, I gotta go to the bathroom. I got up and she said – you want me to help you? She grabbed me, she got me by my hand and was walking with me and said – auntie, why are you sick? I said honey, I said baby I don't know. So she said – do you want something to eat? I said no. She said – I'm going to go downstairs and I’m going to put a can of chicken noodle soup in the microwave for you. I said – make sure you don’t burn yourself, it was warm enough to her taste. She brought it upstairs and I said – sit it over there, I’ll eat a little bit at a time. Then I went into the bathroom and I took all of my clothes off, I looked in the mirror and just looked at myself, I just looked at myself and this thought came to me, I don't know why that thought came to me but the words that came outta my mouth was…you're HIV positive.",

I just knew I needed to find out what I needed to do at that point. That’s when I asked them what I needed to do and they told me I needed to start going to the health department, the EI Clinic, that I could get some medication and get some help there. So that’s what I did. Since I found out I was HIV positive, I have no problems at all, I am doing very well. It doesn’t bother me. You know what I'm saying?

I became a parent at 13 because my mother died and she told me to take care our baby, just everybody take care our baby. And I was 13, I think he was about four. No, he had to be about three. I said okay – and I looked up, I was a mom at 13 in a sense, helping take care her baby. And as of today that baby, I still have that child and he’s in his 40’s with kids, and not only…I mean, he still stays with me. So I'm still, and I made a promise to a dying woman. I have to look out for her son, you know, this baby. And I'm like – when do I let that go. And my dad said well, you know she’s dead. You let that go. I said – she might be dead but I made a promise. This boy’s about 42 years old and he still stay with me. So I'm like – when do I let go and when do I become a woman in a sense, even though I had two kids and I had my brothers and sisters and they would tell me – why did you have kids? You had us! And I'm like – but I wanted somebody of my own. Even though it was my brother, I loved him, but I wanted my own kids. I didn't want but two, two was enough because my mother died and there was six under me and four over me. And so I became a mom at a young age and to ask when did I become an adult or when did I become my own woman and I have to say…I would say at um 48 when I let go of my husband. Because there’s always a child, a husband, so I never been on my own. So I'm standing by myself without a husband but I still have those kids. So I'm finding who I am as a woman now, searching for the last five years I guess, finding this woman that’s somewhere inside of me – I'm not even sure who she is or what she would like or what she would like to do, you know?

I became a parent at 13 because my mother died and she told me to take care our baby, just everybody take care our baby. And I was 13, I think he was about four. No, he had to be about three. I said okay – and I looked up, I was a mom at 13 in a sense, helping take care her baby. And as of today that baby, I still have that child and he’s in his 40’s with kids, and not only…I mean, he still stays with me. So I'm still, and I made a promise to a dying woman. I have to look out for her son, you know, this baby. And I'm like – when do I let that go. And my dad said well, you know she’s dead. You let that go. I said – she might be dead but I made a promise. This boy’s about 42 years old and he still stay with me. So I'm like – when do I let go and when do I become a woman in a sense, even though I had two kids and I had my brothers and sisters and they would tell me – why did you have kids? You had us! And I'm like – but I wanted somebody of my own. Even though it was my brother, I loved him, but I wanted my own kids. I didn't want but two, two was enough because my mother died and there was six under me and four over me. And so I became a mom at a young age and to ask when did I become an adult or when did I become my own woman and I have to say…I would say at um 48 when I let go of my husband. Because there’s always a child, a husband, so I never been on my own. So I'm standing by myself without a husband but I still have those kids. So I'm finding who I am as a woman now, searching for the last five years I guess, finding this woman that’s somewhere inside of me – I'm not even sure who she is or what she would like or what she would like to do, you know? At this late stage I'm still looking for that woman within me.",

Your bank account, it controls you…your whole ability to thinking. And I had no control over my life for those two years. It was like – I was losing me. And really and truly HIV was an easier task than being on drugs. If I didn't have my mom I probably would still be out there, really in a bad situation in the streets. I never got to the point of doing things for drugs because I had family that tried that kept me off the streets, or tried to keep me off the streets.

So I write my thoughts down. I was living with my daughter when my husband died, I had nowhere to go; I lost my home, I lost the vehicles, I lost everything in my home down to my clothes. Me and my dog is all I have. So I’ve been living with her for almost two years; April the 1st of this year I moved in my own place. She, being nosy or whatever, she read my diary. And in my diary it said I’d been diagnosed since 2000 with hepatitis C, nothing about HIV. She treats me like I am a disease. She’ll hug me, she’ll kiss me right here. There’s the grandkids come and stay with me, and I cook. If I have something left over and they're still hungry on my plate and I offer to put it on their plate, she has a fit! To where – now you know that’s unacceptable! They can't eat after you and they can’t drink after you! I said – why not? “You know why!” “No I don’t, please tell me why!” I want her to come out and tell me that she knows. But I'm thinking that she knows it’s hepatitis C, when everybody, all my friends and my doctors and case managers tell me that they believe that she knows I have HIV.",

But my girlfriend said – there go your husband…and I said well, he seen me so I guess he’s working or whatever. I just went on. Got a ride to the subway and went on to school.

I said okay – and I looked up, I was a mom at 13 in a sense, helping take care her baby. And as of today that baby, I still have that child and he’s in his 40’s with kids, and not only…I mean, he still stays with me. So I'm still, and I made a promise to a dying woman. I have to look out for her son, you know, this baby. And I'm like – when do I let that go. And my dad said well, you know she’s dead. You let that go. I said – she might be dead but I made a promise. This boy’s about 42 years old and he still stay with me. So I'm like – when do I let go and when do I become a woman in a sense, even though I had two kids and I had my brothers and sisters and they would tell me – why did you have kids? You had us! And I'm like – but I wanted somebody of my own. Even though it was my brother, I loved him, but I wanted my own kids. I didn't want but two, two was enough because my mother died and there was six under me and four over me. And so I became a mom at a young age and to ask when did I become an adult or when did I become my own woman and I have to say…I would say at um 48 when I let go of my husband. Because there’s always a child, a husband, so I never been on my own. So I'm standing by myself without a husband but I still have those kids. So I'm finding who I am as a woman now, searching for the last five years I guess, finding this woman that’s somewhere inside of me – I'm not even sure who she is or what she would like or what she would like to do, you know?

A lot of people that don’t have money, let's put it like this. If I had $100 to put food on the table for my kids, but I needed that $100 to go to the doctor, what do you think that person will do? They’ll take that $100 and feed their children. Because that $100 probably could feed their kids for the month, if you're living in poverty. I'm not going to take the $100 and go to the doctor when I know that I have to survive. So yes, it’s a lot of people that are lacking care because of money.",

I'm a researcher and I'm very, very in tune with my body so I know when something’s not right. I caught a cold, turned into strep, and then the lymph nodes in my neck swelled up. They swelled so bad that I couldn't really turn my neck and I could see lumps sitting outside my neck and I'm just like – oh my gosh, what is that? So researching all the symptoms I had led to lymphoma. Okay, I'm going to call my doctor, I think it’s this but I'm not a doctor so I don't know. And also it wasn’t like okay, this is hanging on for like two days. We’re talking weeks this thing is going on. So I'm scared, call the doctor, I said – I want a biopsy. \n\tWell, when I went in, went to the health department, and they had already had test results from my last HIV test. Normally I never go back for an HIV test, any STD tests were always negative. And I knew how to protect myself. Well, I had been tested since I’d been with my now ex-husband and I didn't go back for test results, because they're always negative. Well, the health department failed to contact me. I slipped through the cracks, they actually told me that because they were trying to say well, we tried to call you, we tried to send you a letter…well no, you didn't. I still live at the same place, phone number’s been the same for years, no you didn't. Just long story short they told me I slipped through the cracks but when I got the news, the nurse couldn't even verbally tell me. Because they all knew me, I'm a really nice person and when I go into places I become a joy (laughter). \n\tWhen I went there I'm sitting in a room, half the size of the room I’m in now, and she pushes a folder towards me and opens it and in red it said HIV Positive. And that’s how I learned. She just couldn’t…It wasn’t that she wasn’t being professional, she was hurt, she was hurt for me. Because her whole demeanor just I just didn't understand. When I got it I screamed, I cried, man I just wanted to leave. I tried to get my keys and my purse, I went to get it and it was gone because she had it hiding behind her and she was barricading the door and she just didn't want me to leave. I understand that. I was telling this story to someone before and they're like – oh my gosh why would she do that? For my protection. I was upset, I was distraught, and I wanted to get in my car and drive. Well, what if I did that? I could have had an accident or anything could have happened. But hearing that news, gosh…",

I was so violated and I looked up one day and I'm like, I would say – I lost my childhood before I was 10. I became a parent at 13 because my mother died and she told me to take care our baby, just everybody take care our baby. And I was 13, I think he was about four. No, he had to be about three. I said okay – and I looked up, I was a mom at 13 in a sense, helping take care her baby. And as of today that baby, I still have that child and he’s in his 40’s with kids, and not only…I mean, he still stays with me. So I'm still, and I made a promise to a dying woman. I have to look out for her son, you know, this baby. And I'm like – when do I let that go. And my dad said well, you know she’s dead. You let that go. I said – she might be dead but I made a promise. This boy’s about 42 years old and he still stay with me. So I'm like – when do I let go and when do I become a woman in a sense, even though I had two kids and I had my brothers and sisters and they would tell me – why did you have kids? You had us! And I'm like – but I wanted somebody of my own. Even though it was my brother, I loved him, but I wanted my own kids. I didn't want but two, two was enough because my mother died and there was six under me and four over me. And so I became a mom at a young age and to ask when did I become an adult or when did I become my own woman and I have to say…I would say at um 48 when I let go of my husband. Because there’s always a child, a husband, so I never been on my own. So I'm standing by myself without a husband but I still have those kids. So I'm finding who I am as a woman now, searching for the last five years I guess, finding this woman that’s somewhere inside of me – I'm not even sure who she is or what she would like or what she would like to do, you know? At this late stage I'm still looking for that woman within me.",

She said, whenever you need anything, call me, no matter what time it is, just call me. She said to get out, even if it’s by yourself, go to the park, walk in the park, go see a movie, if I don’t have anyone to go with, just go by yourself. You don’t need anyone to live your life, to enjoy yourself. Now I’m starting to practice that.

I’ve been able to help other women, connect with other women, network with other women, come up with ideas so we can help make an impact on our community and dispel myths and stop stigmas. It’s just been great. Even doing the research studies, I always say yes, I never say no. There are a lot of people who are afraid of research, even if it is questioning. Because just fear, lack of knowing, years ago it was always said – what goes on in the house stays in the house, don’t tell people your business.

Normally I never go back for an HIV test, any STD tests were always negative. And I knew how to protect myself. Well, I had been tested since I’d been with my now ex-husband and I didn't go back for test results, because they're always negative. Well, the health department failed to contact me. I slipped through the cracks, they actually told me that because they were trying to say well, we tried to call you, we tried to send you a letter…well no, you didn't. I still live at the same place, phone number’s been the same for years, no you didn't. Just long story short they told me I slipped through the cracks but when I got the news, the nurse couldn't even verbally tell me. Because they all knew me, I'm a really nice person and when I go into places I become a joy (laughter). \n\tWhen I went there I'm sitting in a room, half the size of the room I’m in now, and she pushes a folder towards me and opens it and in red it said HIV Positive. And that’s how I learned. She just couldn’t…It wasn’t that she wasn’t being professional, she was hurt, she was hurt for me. Because her whole demeanor just I just didn't understand. When I got it I screamed, I cried, man I just wanted to leave. I tried to get my keys and my purse, I went to get it and it was gone because she had it hiding behind her and she was barricading the door and she just didn't want me to leave. I understand that.

I'm so open about my health and everything that I felt like it was something the family should know so they can be there to support you.

Honestly I’ve met more people, I’ve been able to do a whole lot as an advocate and a woman living with HIV. I’ve been able to help other women, connect with other women, network with other women, come up with ideas so we can help make an impact on our community and dispel myths and stop stigmas. It’s just been great. Even doing the research studies, I always say yes, I never say no. There are a lot of people who are afraid of research, even if it is questioning. Because just fear, lack of knowing, years ago it was always said – what goes on in the house stays in the house, don’t tell people your business. But a lot of these things help other people and that’s what I'm about, helping other people. If I have to be a part of it, I care. That’s it because I’ll keep talking (laughter).",

I just wanted to be cool with everybody until as a kid, you see that there are differences because you get older people who are showing you that prejudice and trying to teach you that prejudice. I didn't have a difference between races until I was like in the second grade, having a best friend who was white and got invited to her house and when I went, her dad was like – what are you doing here (when he opened the door). I'm like – I'm here for the taco party! “We don’t allow niggers”...I'm a kid and I'm just like –what the what! I knew that word from watching Roots andthings like that, but never experienced it. She’s behind him and she’s sad and her little sister, they called me ‘Alicia’ and she’s like –let Aliciain, let Aliciain. My friend’s name was [M] and her sister’s name was[R] . He would not let me in and I ran home crying and my Mom went around there, I don't know what my crazy Mom did or said (laughter). She laughs because I call her that because my Mom really took up for us. All parents normally do, butif I got into a situation, my Mom always sent me away and she handled it, and I don't know what my crazy Mother did but all Iknow is after I saw [M] again I wasn’t allowed to speak to her. Her parents, if they saw me coming they would pull her away. She would just be looking like –oh, I can't talk to you. We’d be in school and we couldn't talk. It was just bad",

I used to wear glasses, contact lenses; when I was growing up I always wore glasses but I had contact lenses then. And he just continued to pound on me and he detached a retina in one eye and then caused glaucoma in the other eye. So eventually I lost sight in both.",

So for one, WIHS took a lot of weight off of our primary care doctors because WIHS does so much for us, from the Pap smear to the…so when I go to see my primary care doctor, she’s like—okay Cordelia, what you need? Some paperwork filled out or refills sent down? And let me check your heart and look in your ears, okay, have a good day (laughter). And for a while I was like dang, that’s not fair, she don’t have to do nothing! Here it is research got to do all this different stuff.
